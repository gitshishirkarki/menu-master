## Menu Master

## Project Overview
MenuMaster is a web application designed to empower restaurant owners by allowing them to manage their menus efficiently. The application enables restaurant owners to sign up, add menu items, generate QR codes for their menus, and provide a user-friendly interface for customers to view the menus.

## Stakeholders
- **Restaurant Owners**: Users who will manage their restaurant menus.
- **Customers**: Users who will scan QR codes to view restaurant menus.
- **Developers**: Individuals responsible for building and maintaining the application.

## Functional Requirements
1. **User Authentication**
   - Restaurant owners should be able to sign up for an account.
   - Users should be able to log in securely.
   - Passwords should be stored securely (hashed).

2. **Menu Management**
   - Restaurant owners should be able to add new menu items.
   - Users should be able to edit existing menu items.
   - Users should be able to delete menu items.

3. **QR Code Generation**
   - The application should generate a QR code for each menu item.
   - QR codes should link to a beautiful, user-friendly menu display for customers.

4. **Multiple Restaurant Support**
   - The application should support multiple restaurant owners, each with their own unique menus.

## Non-functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The application should load within 2 seconds.
- **Security**: User data should be encrypted, and secure authentication methods should be implemented.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for both restaurant owners and customers.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The application will be built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

## Additional Notes
- Regular user feedback will be collected to improve the application.
- Documentation will be maintained throughout the development process to ensure clarity and alignment among stakeholders.
